# WeatherPy

This program grabs a bunch of random cities and provides information about their coordinates, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, comparing the latter four attributes against latitude in the form of scatter plots divided by hemisphere.

# VacationPy

This program takes the cities gathered by WeatherPy and narrows them down to find the ideal vacation spot, if such a spot even has a hotel, which it probably doesn't.
